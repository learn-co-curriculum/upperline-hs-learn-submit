## We Want Green!

Have you noticed the lights on the right hand side of Learn? We're sure you have! There are a few ways to make those lights turn green, and mark that lesson or lab as complete.

For right now, we're just going to teach you one way to handle the labs you work on.

### Step 1:

That very first light that says `Fork`? Just click the `Open in Nitrous` button at the very top. The light will automatically turn green. Don't worry what `Fork` means if you don't know, we'll get there.

### Step 2:

Once you finish the lab, there is one quick and easy step to making that second light turn green, the one that says `Pull Request`.

In terminal, in the directory of the lab, simply enter `learn submit`. This will store all your code on GitHub, so that you're building your coding portfolio, and let us know you've finished the lab.

### But I worked In A Group And I Don't Have the Code

Obviously we want everyone to get credit for completing the lab. If you didn't actually type the solution on your own computer, but contributed to group work, the person who has the code on their computer just has to enter in terminal:

```bash 
learn submit --team list, of, github, usernames
```

For example, if a student named Danny was working with two students, Victoria and Lyel, and Danny had the code on his computer, he would enter in terminal:

```bash
learn submit --team vicfriedman, lresner
```

The code will also appear on Danny's GitHub, as well as Victoria's and Lyel's. Victoria and Lyel will also get green lights on Learn!
